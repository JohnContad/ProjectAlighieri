# ProjectAlighieri

## Why?

'ProjectAlighieri' aims to tell the story of the Divine Comedy, through a modern lens. It is a collaboration between several NoSleep writers; each Circle of Inferno being a standalone story managed and written by a single individual. With this project, we aim to break the mold of the 'nosleep' story and attempt to explore alternative avenues to storytelling.

## Who?

Current participants to ProjectAlighieri are as follows:

 - /u/thespecialblank
 - /u/sleepyhollow_101

## What?

The project will take place in three phases:

### Phase 1: The Skeleton

This version will contain the basic text and the skeleton of the game. It will be composed of hyperlinks, but will nevertheless contain the full story.

### Phase 2

Phase 2 will include images and custom art. The art placements will be primarily in-body, and will be accompaniments to the story as a whole.

### Phase 3: Final product

The final product may contain music and background images so as to be more immersive. Possibly animations, or cinemagraphs.

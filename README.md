# ProjectAlighieri

## Why?

'ProjectAlighieri' aims to tell the story of the Divine Comedy, through a modern lens. It is a collaboration between several NoSleep writers; each Circle of Inferno being a standalone story managed and written by a single individual. With this project, we aim to break the mold of the 'nosleep' story and attempt to explore alternative avenues to storytelling.

## What?

The project will take place in three phases:

### Version 1: The Skeleton

This version will contain the basic text and the skeleton of the game. It will be composed of hyperlinks, but will nevertheless contain the full story.

### Version 2: Now with more art!

Phase 2 will include images and custom art. The art placements will be primarily in-body, and will be accompaniments to the story as a whole.

### Version 3: Final product

The final product may contain music and background images so as to be more immersive. Possibly animations, or cinemagraphs.

## Writing guidelines

Writing guidelines will be loose and hugely autonomous. Each circle of hell will be managed and written by one person, and it's up to them how they want to tell the story. The only real rules are as follows:

#### 1.) The backstory of the protagonist will be told through his experiences in hell. 

The only characterization that matters is that the protagonist has lived a long, sinful life. Through his experiences in hell, he is forced to look at his past deeds, reenacted in various, ghoulish ways. The actual details of his life will be up to you.

#### 2.) The protagonist cannot go through the tenth door until he has completed all nine doors.

The protagonist has to go through each door and his personal version of hell. Upon completion of the experience, he will return to the first room, once again, forced to open another door.

#### 3.) Hell is personal.

 Keep in mind that this is the protagonist's /personal/ version of hell - every depiction of suffering must be experienced by the main character.
